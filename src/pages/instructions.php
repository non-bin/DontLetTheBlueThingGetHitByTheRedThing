    <div class="game instructions">
        You are the Blue Thing.<br>
        Use your arrow keys to move.<br>
        Every time you move, The Red Thing will move too.<br>
        <br>
        The Red Thing has a sopfisticated AI which looks like this:<br>
        <code>enemy.move(Math.random());</code><br>
        this may be hard for your tiny brain to understand,<br>
        so just play the game and don't worry about it ok?<br>
        <br>
        Have fun :)
